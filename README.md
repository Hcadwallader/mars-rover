## comments

Things I would have done next:

Note I'm using version 3.9.6 of python which doesn't support switch statements, if I had time I would have upgrade to improve readability of code

I would put the utilites file in a seperate folder and add some tests around the method

I would also have liked to add more error checking and handling unexpected input formats/types to make the programme more robust
